Apollo Guidance Computer for Kerbal Space Program.

Thanks to Ron Burkey (<info@sandroid.org>) for VirtualAGC!

This is my reimplementation of the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) and Display/Keyboard (DSKY) for Kerbal Space Program.

Prerequisites:
---

- KSP (tested on 1.0.5), should work on any version that Telemachus works on
- python 3.x
- PyQt5
- Telemachus mod for KSP
- Mechjeb mod

Installation:
---
See doc/installation.md

Running basaGC:
-----

To run basaGC, unzip the download to a folder of your choice. On Linux, in a terminal change to
that directory and type "./basagc.py", on Windows double-click on the file basagc.py.



Please Note! This is a work in progress. Only a few functions of the AGC are implemented. Some buttons and warning
lamps don't work.

Historical note: I have attempted to follow, as closely as possible and with the documentation available to me, the
real life AGC. It should be noted that this is a superficial recreation, not a hard-core simulation of the AGC. Google
"Virtual AGC" for that!

Known issues:
