TMI (Trans-Munar Injection) (P15):
---------

- Key in V37E15E (Execute Program 15: Calculate TMI burn)
- Check P15 is running
- Check V21 N25 (Load data into data register 1: vessel mass (whole part)) flashing
- Key in (without sign) vessel mass (whole part), followed by ENTR
- Check V22 N25 (Load data into data register 2: vessel mass (fractional part)) flashing
- Key in (without sign) vessel mass (fractional part), followed by ENTR
- Check V21 N31 (Load data into data register 1: total thrust (whole part)) flashing
- Key in (without sign) total thrust (whole part), followed by ENTR
- Check V22 N31 (Load data into data register 2: total thrust (fractional part)) flashing
- Key in (without sign) total thrust (fractional part), followed by ENTR
- Check V21 N38 (Load data into data register 1: Specific impulse (Isp)) flashing
- Key in (without sign) Specific impulse, followed by ENTR
- Calculation complete
- Check Program 00 is running
- Check V06 N95 (Display on 3 data registers: TMI Burn Data Display)
  - R1: Time to ignition (TIG) (mmbss minutes, blank, seconds,)
  - R2: Delta-V for burn (xxxxx m/s)
  - R3: Predicted Velocity at cutoff (xxxxx m/s)

- Key in V37E40E (Execute Program 40: Execute burn)
- Check P40 running
- Check V16 N40 (monitor on 3 data registers: Burn Data)
  - R1: Time to ignition (TIG) (mmbss minutes, blank, seconds,)
  - R2: Delta-V for burn (xxxxx m/s)
  - R3: Accumulated delta-V (xxxxx m/s)
- Check R1 counting down
- ENSURE timewarp is halted before T-2 minutes
- At T-1m45s, display blanks
- After 5 seconds, display returns. Attitude autopilot engages
- Check vessel maneuvering to point to maneuver node
- At T-10 seconds, display blanks
- Check flashing V99 (Please enable engine)
- Key in PRO
- Display resumes, engine ignites at t=0
- Check R3 (Accumulated delta-V) imcreasing
- Check for engine cutoff at approx R2 value
- Check autopilot disarmed
- Check P00 running
- Check V06 N14 (Display on 3 registers: Burn error display)
  - R1: Expected Δv at cutoff (xxxxx m/s)
  - R2: Actual Δv at cutoff (xxxxx m/s)
  - R3: Difference (xxxx.x m/s)
- Check for Mun intercept
